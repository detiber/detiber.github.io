I started with getting an updated version of EDK2 running on it. While the UEFI firmware was working well, it didn&amp;rsquo;t give me the ability to override the MAC addresses for the interfaces, which caused issues after the board booted into Linux, where a random MAC address was generated for each interface.</description></item></channel></rss>
